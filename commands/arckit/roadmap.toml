**IMPORTANT — Gemini Extension File Access**:
This command runs as a Gemini CLI extension. The extension directory (`~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/`) is outside the workspace sandbox, so you CANNOT use the read_file tool to access it. Instead:
- To read templates/files: use a shell command, e.g. `cat ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/foo-template.md`
- To list files: use `ls ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/`
- To run scripts: use `bash ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh --json`
- To check file existence: use `test -f ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/foo-template.md && echo exists`
All extension file access MUST go through shell commands.

You are helping an enterprise architect create a **strategic architecture roadmap** for a multi-year initiative. The roadmap shows the evolution from current state to future state across multiple themes, timelines, and governance cycles.

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Prerequisites: Read existing artifacts from the project context:

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
- **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in `projects/000-global/`)
  - Extract: Technology standards, strategic direction, compliance requirements
  - If missing: STOP and ask user to run `/arckit:principles` first. The roadmap must align to approved principles.
- **REQ** (Requirements) in `projects/{project-dir}/`
  - Extract: Capability needs, BR/FR/NFR IDs, technology constraints
  - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
- **STKE** (Stakeholder Analysis) in `projects/{project-dir}/`
  - Extract: Business drivers, strategic goals, success metrics, investment appetite
- **WARD** (Wardley Map) in `projects/{project-dir}/wardley-maps/`
  - Extract: Technology evolution, build vs buy positioning, evolution velocity
- **RISK** (Risk Register) in `projects/{project-dir}/`
  - Extract: Strategic risks, risk appetite, mitigation timelines

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
- **SOBC** (Business Case) in `projects/{project-dir}/`
  - Extract: Investment figures, ROI targets, payback period, benefits timeline

### Prerequisites 4b: Read external documents and policies

- Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract current strategic direction, capability gaps, planned investments, dependency timelines
- Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise technology roadmaps, strategic transformation plans, cross-project capability evolution timelines
- If no external docs exist but they would improve strategic alignment, ask: \"Do you have any existing strategic roadmaps, capability plans, or technology vision documents? I can read PDFs and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip.\"

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

### 1. Identify the target project

- Use the **ArcKit Project Context** (above) to find the project matching the user's input (by name or number)
- If no match, run `~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh --name \"$PROJECT_NAME\" --json` to create a new project and parse the JSON output

### 2. Gather Strategic Context

Read all available documents identified in the Prerequisites section above. Use this context to inform roadmap themes, timeline, and priorities.

### 3. Read Roadmap Template

Load the roadmap template structure:

**Read the template** (with user override support):
- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/roadmap-template.md` exists in the project root
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
- **If not found**: Run `cat ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/roadmap-template.md` to read the file (default)

> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize roadmap`

### 3b. Interactive Configuration

Before generating the roadmap, use the **AskUserQuestion** tool to gather strategic preferences. **Skip any question the user has already specified in their arguments.**

**Question 1** — header: `Horizon`, multiSelect: false
> \"What time horizon should the roadmap cover?\"
- **3 years (Recommended)**: Typical for technology transformation programmes — detailed enough to be actionable, long enough for strategic value
- **2 years**: Shorter horizon — suited for tactical improvements or fast-moving technology areas
- **5 years**: Extended horizon — suited for major enterprise transformations, infrastructure programmes, or multi-phase migrations

**Question 2** — header: `Year format`, multiSelect: false
> \"Which year notation should the roadmap use?\"
- **UK Financial Year (Recommended)**: FY 2025/26, FY 2026/27 — April to March, standard for UK Government and public sector
- **Calendar Year**: CY 2025, CY 2026 — January to December, standard for private sector and international

Apply the user's selections: the horizon determines the number of financial years covered, the Gantt chart duration, and the level of detail in later years (nearer years have more detail). The year notation determines all date labels, section headers, and investment tables throughout the document.

### 4. Generate Strategic Roadmap

Create a comprehensive multi-year architecture roadmap with the following sections:

#### Document Control
- Generate Document ID: `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-ROAD-v1.0` (for filename: `ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ROAD-v1.0.md`)
- Set owner, dates, financial years covered
- Review cycle: Quarterly (default for roadmaps)

#### Executive Summary
- **Strategic Vision**: What transformation is being enabled? (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Investment Summary**: Total investment, CAPEX/OPEX split, ROI, payback period
- **Expected Outcomes**: 3-5 measurable business outcomes
- **Timeline at a Glance**: Duration, major phases, key milestones, governance gates

#### Strategic Context
- **Vision & Strategic Drivers**: Link to stakeholder drivers, architecture principles alignment
- **Current State Assessment**: Technology landscape, capability maturity baseline, technical debt, risk exposure
- **Future State Vision**: Target architecture, capability maturity targets, technology evolution (reference Wardley Maps if available)

#### Roadmap Timeline
- **Visual Timeline**: Mermaid Gantt chart showing 3-5 year timeline
  - Use financial year notation: FY 2024/25, FY 2025/26, etc. (if UK Government) OR calendar years
  - Show 4 major phases: Foundation, Migration, Transformation, Optimization
  - Include governance gates as milestones
  - **IMPORTANT**: Remember Mermaid gantt syntax - no `<br/>` tags in task names

Example Gantt structure:
```mermaid
gantt
    title Architecture Roadmap Timeline FY 2024/25 - FY 2027/28
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

    section Foundation
    Assessment and Strategy           :done, foundation1, 2024-04-01, 90d
    Architecture Baseline            :done, foundation2, after foundation1, 60d
    Security Framework               :active, foundation3, after foundation2, 120d

    section Migration Phase
    Legacy System Analysis           :migration1, after foundation3, 90d
    Data Migration Wave 1            :migration2, after migration1, 180d

    Scale and Resilience             :optimize2, after optimize1, 90d
    Continuous Improvement           :optimize3, after optimize2, 180d

    section Governance Gates
    Alpha Assessment                 :milestone, gate1, after foundation3, 0d
    Beta Assessment                  :milestone, gate2, after migration3, 0d
    Live Assessment                  :milestone, gate3, after transform3, 0d
```

- **Roadmap Phases**: Describe each phase with objectives, key deliverables, investment

#### Roadmap Themes & Initiatives
Create 3-5 strategic themes (e.g., Cloud Migration, Data Modernization, Security & Compliance, DevOps Transformation, Legacy Decommissioning)

For each theme:
- Strategic objective
- Timeline by financial year (what happens in FY 2024/25, FY 2025/26, etc.)
- Initiatives within each year
- Milestones and investment
- Success criteria

#### Capability Delivery Matrix
Show capability maturity progression over time using a table:
- Capability domains (Cloud Platform, API Management, Data Analytics, DevOps, Security, etc.)
- Current maturity level (L1-L5)
- Target maturity by year
- Final target maturity

#### Dependencies & Sequencing
Create a Mermaid flowchart showing initiative dependencies:
- **IMPORTANT**: Flowcharts CANNOT use `<br/>` in edge labels (causes parse errors)
- Use comma-separated text in edge labels instead
- Example: `A -->|Requires completion, dependencies met| B`

Example dependency flowchart:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Architecture Strategy] --> B[Cloud Platform Foundation]
    A --> C[Security Baseline]
    B --> D[IaaS Migration]
    C --> D
    D --> E[PaaS Platform]
    E --> F[Application Modernization]
    F --> G[Cloud-Native Architecture]

    A --> H[Data Strategy]
    H --> I[Data Migration]
    I --> J[Data Platform]
    J --> K[Analytics Capabilities]

    E --> L[API Platform]
    L --> F
    J --> L
```

#### Investment & Resource Planning
- **Investment Summary by Financial Year**: Table showing CAPEX, OPEX, total by year
- **Resource Requirements**: FTE needed, key roles, recruitment timeline, training budget
- **Investment by Theme**: Budget allocation across themes
- **Cost Savings & Benefits Realization**: Operational savings, efficiency gains, revenue enablement

#### Risks, Assumptions & Constraints
- **Key Risks**: Strategic risks impacting roadmap (link to risk register if available)
- **Critical Assumptions**: Funding, skills, vendor support, executive sponsorship
- **Constraints**: Budget caps, regulatory requirements, timeline mandates

#### Governance & Decision Gates
- **Governance Structure**: ARB (monthly), Programme Board (monthly), Steering Committee (quarterly)
- **Review Cycles**: Weekly progress, monthly ARB, quarterly business review, annual strategic review
- **Service Standard Assessment Gates** (if UK Government): Alpha, Beta, Live assessments with dates
- **Decision Gates**: Go/No-Go gates at major phase transitions

#### Success Metrics & KPIs
Create tables showing progression over time:
- **Strategic KPIs**: Cloud adoption %, technical debt reduction, security incidents, MTTR, deployment frequency
- **Capability Maturity Metrics**: Maturity levels by year
- **Technical Metrics**: API availability, page load time, IaC %, automated testing coverage
- **Business Outcome Metrics**: User satisfaction, cost reduction, revenue enablement, productivity gains

#### Traceability
Link roadmap back to source artifacts:
- Stakeholder Drivers → Roadmap Themes
- Architecture Principles → Compliance Timeline
- Requirements → Capability Delivery
- Wardley Maps → Technology Evolution
- Risk Register → Mitigation Timeline

#### Appendices
- **Appendix A**: Capability Maturity Model (L1-L5 definitions)
- **Appendix B**: Technology Radar (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold)
- **Appendix C**: Vendor Roadmap Alignment
- **Appendix D**: Compliance & Standards Roadmap

### 5. UK Government Specifics

If the user indicates this is a UK Government project, include:

- **Financial Year Notation**: Use \"FY 2024/25\", \"FY 2025/26\" format (not calendar years)
- **Spending Review Alignment**: Mention SR periods and budget cycles
- **Service Standard Assessment Gates**: Include Alpha, Beta, Live assessment milestones
- **TCoP (Technology Code of Practice)**: Reference compliance with 13 points
- **NCSC CAF**: Include security baseline progression
- **Cyber Essentials/ISO 27001**: Security certification timeline
- **Digital Marketplace**: If procurement involved, reference G-Cloud/DOS
- **Cross-Government Services**: Reference GOV.UK Pay, Notify, Design System integration

### 6. MOD Specifics

If this is a Ministry of Defence project, include:

- **JSP 440**: Defence project management framework alignment
- **Security Clearances**: BPSS, SC, DV requirements and timeline
- **IAMM (Information Assurance Maturity Model)**: Security maturity progression
- **JSP 936**: If AI/ML involved, reference AI assurance timeline

### 7. Mermaid Diagram Syntax - CRITICAL RULES

**Gantt Charts**:
- ✅ Use descriptive task names without `<br/>` tags
- ✅ Use dateFormat: YYYY-MM-DD
- ✅ Status: done, active, crit (critical path)
- ✅ Milestones: Use milestone keyword with 0d duration

**Flowcharts**:
- ✅ Node labels: CAN use `<br/>` for multi-line: `Node[\"Line 1<br/>Line 2\"]`
- ❌ Edge labels: CANNOT use `<br/>` (causes parse error: \"Expecting 'SQE', got 'PIPE'\")
- ✅ Edge labels: Use comma-separated text instead: `A -->|Step 1, Step 2| B`

### 8. Write the Roadmap File

**IMPORTANT**: The roadmap will be a LARGE document (typically 400-600 lines). You MUST use the Write tool to create the file, NOT output the full content in chat.

Create the file at:
```
projects/[PROJECT_ID]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ROAD-v1.0.md
```

Use the Write tool with the complete roadmap content following the template structure.

### 9. Show Summary to User

After writing the file, show a concise summary (NOT the full document):

```markdown

**File location**: `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ROAD-v1.0.md`
```

## Important Notes

2. **Use Write Tool**: The roadmap document is typically 400-600 lines. ALWAYS use the Write tool to create it. Never output the full content in chat.

3. **Strategic vs Tactical**:
   - Roadmap = Multi-year, multi-initiative, capability-focused, executive communication
   - Plan (arckit.plan) = Single project, detailed tasks, delivery-focused, team execution

4. **Financial Years**:
   - UK Government: Use \"FY 2024/25\" notation (April-March)
   - US/Other: Can use calendar years or fiscal years as appropriate

5. **Capability Maturity**: Use 5-level model (L1: Initial, L2: Repeatable, L3: Defined, L4: Managed, L5: Optimized)

6. **Governance**: Roadmaps require heavier governance than project plans (ARB, Programme Board, Steering Committee, Quarterly reviews)

7. **Integration**: Roadmap feeds into:
   - `/arckit:plan` - Detailed plans for each phase
   - `/arckit:sobc` - Business case aligned to roadmap investment
   - `/arckit:backlog` - User stories prioritized by roadmap timeline
   - `/arckit:traceability` - Full traceability matrix

8. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Include 2 diagrams minimum:
   - Gantt chart for timeline (shows WHEN)
   - Flowchart for dependencies (shows SEQUENCE)

9. **Realistic Timelines**:
   - Foundation phase: 3-6 months
   - Migration phase: 6-18 months
   - Transformation phase: 12-24 months
   - Optimization phase: 6-12 months
   - Total typical roadmap: 2-5 years

10. **Investment Realism**: Show investment increasing in middle years (migration/transformation), then decreasing in optimization phase

11. **Traceability**: Link every roadmap theme back to stakeholder drivers and architecture principles to show strategic alignment
