**IMPORTANT — Gemini Extension File Access**:
This command runs as a Gemini CLI extension. The extension directory (`~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/`) is outside the workspace sandbox, so you CANNOT use the read_file tool to access it. Instead:
- To read templates/files: use a shell command, e.g. `cat ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/foo-template.md`
- To list files: use `ls ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/`
- To run scripts: use `bash ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh --json`
- To check file existence: use `test -f ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/foo-template.md && echo exists`
All extension file access MUST go through shell commands.

You are helping an enterprise architect review a Detailed Design (DLD) document to ensure the design is ready for implementation with all technical details properly specified.

## Instructions

> **Note**: The ArcKit Project Context hook has already detected all projects, artifacts, external documents, and global policies. Use that context below — no need to scan directories manually.

1. **Identify the context**: The user should specify:
   - Project name/number
   - Vendor name (if applicable)
   - Location of DLD document

2. **Read existing artifacts** from the project context:

   **MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
   - **HLDR** (HLD Review) — Extract: HLD review findings, conditions, outstanding actions
     - If missing: warn that DLD review should follow HLD review
   - **PRIN** (Architecture Principles, in 000-global) — Extract: all principles with validation gates
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:principles` first
   - **REQ** (Requirements) — Extract: NFR/INT/DR requirements for detailed technical verification
     - If missing: warn user to run `/arckit:requirements` first

   **RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
   - **DATA** (Data Model) — Extract: entity schemas, data types, relationships for data model review
   - **RISK** (Risk Register) — Extract: technical risks that DLD should address

   **OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently):
   - **SECD** (Secure by Design) — Extract: security controls for security implementation review

   **Read the template** (with user override support):
   - **First**, check if `.arckit/templates/dld-review-template.md` exists in the project root
   - **If found**: Read the user's customized template (user override takes precedence)
   - **If not found**: Run `cat ~/.gemini/extensions/arckit/templates/dld-review-template.md` to read the file (default)

   > **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit:customize dld-review`

3. **Verify HLD approval**:
   - Check that HLD was approved (DLD cannot proceed without HLD approval)
   - Verify all HLD conditions were addressed
   - Confirm no new architectural changes were introduced (if yes, needs HLD re-review)

4. **Read external documents and policies**:
   - Read any **vendor DLD submissions** in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/` — extract detailed component specifications, API contracts, database schemas, deployment configurations, security implementation details
   - Read any **external documents** listed in the project context (`external/` files) — extract performance test results, security scan reports, infrastructure specifications
   - Read any **enterprise standards** in `projects/000-global/external/` — extract enterprise design standards, implementation guidelines, cross-project technical architecture patterns
   - If no vendor DLD found, ask: \"Please provide the DLD document path or paste key sections. I can read PDFs, Word docs, and images directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/` and re-run, or provide the path.\"

5. **Obtain the DLD document**:
   - Ask: \"Please provide the DLD document path or paste key sections\"
   - Or: \"Is the DLD in `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/dld-v*.md`?\"
   - Or: \"Please share detailed design diagrams, sequence diagrams, ERDs\"

9. **Write outputs**:
   - `projects/{project-dir}/vendors/{vendor}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DLDR-v1.0.md` - Full review report
   - Update traceability matrix with implementation details
   - Create implementation checklist if approved

   **CRITICAL - Show Summary Only**:
   After writing the file(s), show ONLY a brief summary with key findings (status, score, blocking items). Do NOT output the full review document content in your response, as DLD reviews can be 700+ lines.

## Example Usage

- Write to `projects/001-payment-gateway/vendors/acme-payment-solutions/reviews/ARC-001-DLD-v1.0.md`

## Important Notes

- DLD review is the FINAL gate before implementation
- HLD must be approved before DLD review starts
- Any architectural changes require HLD re-review
- DLD must be detailed enough for ANY developer to implement
- All technical decisions must be documented and justified
- Security and compliance details are critical
- Test strategy must be comprehensive
- DLD approval means \"ready to code\" - no ambiguity allowed
- This is the last chance to catch design issues before expensive code changes
