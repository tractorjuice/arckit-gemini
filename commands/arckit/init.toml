# ArcKit Project Initialization

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Instructions

1. **Check if project structure already exists**:
   - Look for `projects/` directory in the current working directory
   - If it exists, inform the user and ask if they want to continue

2. **Create the project structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p projects/000-global/policies
   mkdir -p projects/000-global/external
   ```

3. **Provide next steps**:

```
ArcKit project structure initialized:

projects/
├── 000-global/
│   ├── policies/   (organization-wide policies)
│   └── external/   (external reference documents)

Next steps:
1. Run /arckit:principles to create architecture principles
2. Run /arckit:stakeholders to analyze stakeholders for a project
3. Run /arckit:requirements to create requirements

Individual projects will be created automatically in numbered directories (001-*, 002-*).
